## Determinations

Determinations in the field can be of three kinds:

 * First, and of highest reliability (i.e., quality), is making a
   **fallen leaf collection**, and then adding the photos to the
   directory tree. `dapat` should be added to the `direct_det` column in
   the ‘plots’ tab of the spreadsheet.
 * Second, if you are sure a tree is the same taxon as a tree _in the
   same plot_ which has _already been collected_ (as fallen leaves),
   then the determination may be a reference to the collected
   tree. Put the tag number of the collected tree in the `same_as_tag`
   column.
 * Finally, of lowest reliability (but fastest), is making a
   determination _from memory_: place a morphotype code in the
   `direct_det` column of the spreadsheet. However, the morphotype
   must have had leaves collected form another tree (in any plot)
   previously, before this determination is valid.
